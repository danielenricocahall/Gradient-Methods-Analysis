# Gradient-Methods-Analysis
Analysis of Gradient Methods, including Conjugate Gradient, Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam (adaptive moments). While the test case is a simple 1-D function with several local minima, I believe the insights derived here are helpful for understanding how this methods apply in higher dimensional space.
